To run the project:
1) Download the project
1) Create a new database "crud" in mysql.
2) In sts or Eclipse simply click on import new maven project and then import the project.  
3) Run the project as a Spring Boot Application.


Few issues:
1) Thymeleaf simply doesn't display the user-photos from /user-photos directory , hence the file had to be uploaded to static/images/userPhotos directory. Due to this issue,
   recently uploaded image doesn't shpow up in the index.html. To see the image , right click your project on sts or Eclipse then click on Refresh then reload your webpage.
2) Fix for pagination is coming soon . Stay tuned for that.
